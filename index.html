        <li><span class="ercH">Remedy: </span> Procedure 1 If the machine shows SC codes for HDD errors (SC860 to SC865) with SC 925, do the recovery procedures for SC860 to SC865. Procedure 2 If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), turn the machine power off and on. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5832-011 (HDD Formatting – Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: Jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder 
 Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer that: 
 Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased 
 All captured documents will be erased 
 DeskTopBinder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased 
 Documents on the document server, and scanned documents, will not be erased. 
 The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time). Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5832-011, do these steps: 1. Go into the User Tools mode and do &quot;Delivery Settings&quot; to print all received fax documents that are scheduled for delivery. Then erase them. 2. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management Batch Delete Transfer Documents. 3. Do SP5832-011, then turn the machine power off and on. Procedure 3 If &quot;Procedure 2&quot; is not the solution for the problem, do SP5832-001 (HDD Formatting - All), then turn the machine power off and on. SP5832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Ask the customer before you do this SP code. Procedure 4 If &quot;Procedure 3&quot; is not the solution for the problem, replace the HDD.</li>

        <li><span class="ercH">Remedy: </span> Guide for when to replace the HDD 1. When SC863 has occurred ten times or more &bull; The interval is short. &bull; Repeatedly occurs in the same situation (At power-on, etc.). &bull; Startup takes a long time when the main power is turned on. 2. It takes a long time after main power on for the operation panel to become ready. HDD access may be consuming time. Normal HDD access time after main power on is about 5 seconds. If the machine is not waiting for the engine to be ready and it still takes 20 to 30 seconds or more, the HDD may be the cause. If there is a problem with the HDD, HDD-related SCs such as SC860 and SC863 will occur frequently. Print the SC log data and check them.</li>

 Repeatedly occurs in the same situation (At power-on, etc.). 
 Startup takes a long time when the main power is turned on.<br> 2. It takes a long time after main power on for the operation panel to become ready. HDD access may be consuming time. Normal HDD access time after main power on is about 5 seconds. If the machine is not waiting for the engine to be ready and it still takes 20 to 30 seconds or more, the HDD may be the cause. If there is a problem with the HDD, HDD-related SCs such as SC860 and SC863 will occur frequently. Print the SC log data and check them.</li>

 Repeatedly occurs in the same situation (At power-on, etc.). 
 Startup takes a long time when the main power is turned on.<br> 2. It takes a long time after main power on for the operation panel to become ready. HDD access may be consuming time. Normal HDD access time after main power on is about 5 seconds. If the machine is not waiting for the engine to be ready and it still takes 20 to 30 seconds or more, the HDD may be the cause. If there is a problem with the HDD, HDDrelated SCs such as SC860 and SC863 will occur frequently. Print the SC log data and check them.</li>

If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), cycle the main power OFF/ON.<br> 2. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5- 832-11 (HDD Formatting - Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: These are jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder. Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer: 
 Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased 
 All captured documents will be erased 
 Desk Top Binder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased 
 Documents on the document server, and scanned documents, will not be erased. 
 The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time).<br> 3. Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5-832-11, do these steps:<br> 4. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management&gt; Batch Delete Transfer Documents. Do SP5-832-11, and cycle the main power OFF/ON.<br> Procedure 3<br> 1. If “Procedure 2” is not the solution for the problem, do SP5-832-001 (HDD Formatting - All) 2. Cycle the machine OFF/ON. 
 SP5-832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Consult with the customer before you do this SP code.<br> Procedure 4<br> 1. If “Procedure 3” does not solve the problem, replace the HDD.</li>

 Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased 
 All captured documents will be erased 
 Desk Top Binder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased 
 Documents on the document server, and scanned documents will not be erased. 
 The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time).<br> 3.

If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), cycle the main power OFF/ON. 2. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5-832-11 (HDD Formatting - Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: These are jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder. Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer: 
 Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased 
 All captured documents will be erased 
 Desk Top Binder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased 
 Documents on the document server, and scanned documents, will not be erased. 
 The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time). 3. Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5-832-11, do these steps: 4. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management&gt; Batch Delete Transfer Documents. Do SP5-832-11, and cycle the main power OFF/ON.<br> Procedure 3<br> 1. If “Procedure 2” is not the solution for the problem, do SP5-832-001 (HDD Formatting - All) 2. Cycle the machine off/on. 
 SP5-832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Consult with the customer before you do this SP code.<br> Procedure 4 1. If “Procedure 3” does not solve the problem, replace the HDD.</li>
